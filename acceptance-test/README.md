### Advantages:
- **Improved Reliability**: Ensures the application functions correctly in a real-world-like environment.
- **Isolation**: Tests run in a fully contained environment, minimizing dependencies on external systems.
- **Automation**: Enables automated regression testing, reducing manual effort.
- **Scalability**: Can be extended to test different environments and configurations easily.
- **Consistent Results**: Eliminates inconsistencies caused by local setups, leading to more predictable outcomes.

## Features
- **Docker Integration**: Builds the application image and runs tests within a containerized environment.
- **TestContainers**: Sets up necessary dependencies dynamically for the application to run.
- **WireMock**: Mocks external services to ensure controlled and reliable testing.
- **RestAssured**: Simplifies API testing with fluent assertions and validations.
- **JUnit**: Provides the testing framework for executing and reporting results.

## Running the Tests
