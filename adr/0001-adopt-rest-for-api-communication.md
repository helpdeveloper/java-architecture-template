# 1. Adopt REST for API Communication

## Context
For this sample project, we need to decide on the communication protocol for our API. We have two options: REST and gRPC.

## Decision
We will adopt REST as the communication protocol for our API.

## Consequences
- Easy to implement.
- Simple and easy to understand.
- Widely adopted and supported.

## Alternatives Considered
- gRPC: A high-performance, open-source universal RPC framework.

## Rationale
We chose REST because it is simple, easy to implement, and widely adopted. It is a good fit for our project's requirements.
